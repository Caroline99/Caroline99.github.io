 ## Portfolio

 Welcome to my Portfolio Website Project for the She Codes Program, Brisbane 2022.

 This is the first project for submission in the program. I'll be adding another five projects in as many months as I progress through the course and will update the projects page of my website with the details.

 Message just for Ali (lead mentor):

 Thanks again for all your help through this part of the program. :smiley:

 I took the approach of creating the pages in mobile/small view first and then making changes so that it also looks OK on a medium (min-width 501px) and large page (min-width 1025px). 

 I haven't added any javascript functionality to the site yet.

 In my initial design, I included a page called 'personal' where I was going to add some info about my hobbies. I decided to park it, but not fully remove it, and focus on getting the first three pages to a decent state.

 You can find my deployed website [here](https://caroline99.github.io) and my github repo [here](https://github.com/Caroline99/Caroline99.github.io). In my github repo you'll find a Screenshots folder. I've named them in a way that should hopefully make them self-explanatory. 

I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback. I welcome any and all suggestions for improvement.
